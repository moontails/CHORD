# CHORD

- Implemented a peer-to-peer lookup service based on a popular research paper “Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-Peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications”.
- In particular, implemented distributed key lookup and distributed node join.
- Reduced the number of messages that needs to be exchanged through piggybacking at each node.
